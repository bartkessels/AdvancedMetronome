# Advanced Metronome

Advanced Metronome is a small application in which you can set multiple measures with their own speed, time-signature and number of repeats.
This gives you the ability to practice songs that have multiple speeds and/or time-signatures.

## What can I do with it?

Advanced Metronome is created for musicians who want to practice songs which have multiple
speeds and/or time-durations. 'Cause regular metronomes only allow one constant tempo Advanced Metronome
steps in to solve this problem.

Advanced Metronome also gives you the ability to save and share your songs with others so this application will
suit many bands in their song-writing process.

All the available documentation for Advanced Metronome can be found in the [docs folder](docs). The UML diagrams
