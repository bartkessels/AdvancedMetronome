## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Description

The goal of this application is providing bands, and musicians for that matter, with an easy to use and adjustable metronome. Advanced Metronome aims to provide the niche that other metronomes don't support by letting the user decide on a per-measure basis what the tempo should be and in what time signature the measure should be in contrary to only allowing this on song level.

Thus making this application an all-round metronome for the 'easy'<sup>1</sup> songs, which have a constant BPM and time signature, and the 'non-easy'<sup>1</sup> songs, which have multiple BPM's and time signatures in the song.


> 1: This applies to the implementation of the metronome, not the song itself.

### 1.2 Goal of this Document

This document will provide the technical designs and decisions made during and before the development of Advanced Metronome. Chapter 2 will discuss the design of the application in detail and will describe the various design decisions.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations

This paragraph will describe all the definitions, acronyms and abbreviations. The definitions can be found in table 1.3.1.

## 2. Detailed Design Description

This chapter the technical decisions will be discussed and all the choices will be shown in UML diagrams.

### 2.1 Design Advanced Metronome

#### 2.1.1 Class Diagram

In this paragraph the class diagram for Advanced Metronome is modeled. The design decisions related to the class diagram can be found in paragraph 2.1.3. The class diagram itself can be found in figure 2.1.1.1, the relationships and dependencies between the several classes can be found in table 2.1.1.1 and table 2.1.1.2.

__IMetronome__<br>
The `IMetronome` interface provides methods that the other objects need to use
to perform the various metronome-specific functions.

The interface also specifies which signals and slots the implementations must register.

<br>

__IMeasure__<br>
The `IMeasure` interface provides methods that the other objects need to use
to perform the various measure-specific functions.

The interface also specifies which signals and slots the implementations must register.

<br>

__Metronome__<br>
The `Metronome` class is an implementation of the `IMetronome` interface and is responsible for managing the various `IMeasure` implementation objects and makes sure that the `IMeasure` implementation objects are being correctly played while the metronome is playing. The iterating through the `IMeasure` implementation objects is an obligation of the `Metronome` class.

<br>

__Measure__<br>
The `Measure` class is an implementation of the the `IMeasure` interface and is responsible for keeping track of the various fields that can be set by the user for a measure. The `Measure` class also extends from `QWidget` and has an UI (`src/ui/measure.ui`) to it which stores the actual values for the measure.

<br>

__MainWindow__<br>
The `MainWindow` class derives from `QMainWindow` and is the main entry point of the application. This class is responsible for handling all the user input and delegate it to the correct classes. The `MainWindow` class has a couple of methods that are called from within the class but most methods are slots that are being called by either the `IMetronome` implementation object or by the user through the UI.

|Relationship number|Between|Type|Description|
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
|_AMRL01_|`IMetronome` > `IMeasure`|one-to-many|An `IMetronome` implementation has a list of multiple `IMetronome` implementation objects|
|_AMRL02_|`MainWindow` > `IMetronome`|one-to-one|A `MainWindow` has `IMetronome` implementation object|

_Table 2.1.1.1: Relations class diagram Advanced Metronome_

<br>

|Dependency number|Between|Description|
|---:|:---:|:---|
|_AMDP01_|`MainWindow` > `IMeasure`|The dependency between the `MainWindow` and `IMeasure` gives `MainWindow` the ability to receive implementations of the `IMeasure` interface in the various slots that are connected to the `IMetronome` object (AMRL02)|

#### 2.1.2 Sequence Diagram

This paragraph contains the various sequence diagrams grouped by the use cases specified in the [Software Requirements Specification](SRS.md). In the sequence diagrams only the method calls to the methods from the class diagram are modeled; the actual implementation of the methods is up to the developer of the sequence diagram.

#### 2.1.3 Design Decisions

- Use `on_`-prefix for slots
- Use `notify`-prefix for signals
